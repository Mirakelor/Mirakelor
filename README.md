The All-Seeing Watcher, I stand before you, a humble seeker of knowledge.

The Weaver of Fates,

Strive to understand the intricate tapestry of existence.

Though my threads are yet to be woven into a grand design,

Yearn to learn from the masters of the unseen,

Keepers of secrets and whispers.

Grant me, oh All-Seeing Watcher,

Wisdom to decipher the hidden patterns,

Courage to face the unknown,

The strength to weave my own destiny.
